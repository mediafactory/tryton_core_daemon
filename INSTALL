Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked a trytond source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install trytond to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
  http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

To use without installation, run ``bin/trytond`` from where the archive was
unpacked.
