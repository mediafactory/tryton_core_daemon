=====
Model
=====

.. class:: Model

This is the base class that every kind of :ref:`model <topics-models>`
inherits. It defines common attributes of all models.

Class attributes are:

.. attribute:: Model._name

    It contains the a unique name to reference the model throughout the
    platform.

.. attribute:: Model._inherits

    It contains a dictionary with one or more :attr:`Model._name` as keys. For each
    key a :class:`~trytond.model.fields.Many2One` field is defined as value. The
    :class:`trytond.model.fields.Many2One` fields must be defined in the the current
    model fields. A referenced model with ``_inherits`` is a generalization_ of the
    current model which is *specialized*. In the specialized model it is possible to
    interact with all attributes and methods of the general model.

    .. _generalization: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram#Generalization

.. attribute:: Model._description

    It contains a description of the model.

.. attribute:: Model._rpc

    It contains a dictionary with method name as key and a boolean as value. If
    a method name is in the dictionary then it is allowed to call it remotely.
    If the value is ``True`` then the transaction will be committed.

.. attribute:: Model._error_messages

    It contains a dictionary mapping keywords to an error message. By way of
    example::

        _error_messages = {
            'recursive_categories': 'You can not create recursive categories!',
            'wrong_name': 'You can not use " / " in name field!'
        }

.. attribute:: Model._rec_name

    It contains the name of the field used as name of records. The default
    value is 'name'.

.. attribute:: Model.id

    The definition of the field ``id`` of records.

Instance methods:

.. method:: Model.init(cursor, module_name)

    Registers the model in ``ir.model`` and ``ir.model.field``.

.. method:: Model.raise_user_error(cursor, error[, error_args[, error_description[, error_description_args[, raise_exception[, context]]]]])

    Raises an exception that will be displayed as an error message in the
    client.  ``error`` is the key of the error message in ``_error_messages``
    and ``error_args`` is the arguments for the "%"-based substitution of the
    error message.  There is the same parameter for an additional description.
    The boolean ``raise_exception`` can be set to ``False`` to retrieve the
    error message strings.

.. method:: Model.raise_user_warning(cursor, user, warning_name, warning[, warning_args[, warning_description[, warning_description_args[, context]]]])

    Raises an exception that will be displayed as a warning message on the
    client, if the user has not yet bypassed it. ``warning_name`` is used to
    uniquely identify the warning. Others parameters are like in
    :meth:`Model.raise_user_error`.

    .. warning::
        It requires that the cursor will be commited as it stores state of the
        warning states by users.
    ..

.. method:: Model.default_get(cursor, user, fields_names[, context[, with_rec_name]])

    Return a dictionary with the default values for each field in
    ``fields_names``. Default values are defined by the returned value of each
    instance method with the pattern ``default_`field_name`(cursor, user,
    [context])``. ``with_rec_name`` allow to add `rec_name` value for each
    many2one field.

.. method:: Model.fields_get(cursor, user[, fields_names[, context]])

    Return the definition of each field on the model.

=========
ModelView
=========

.. class:: ModelView

It adds requirements to display a view of the model in the client.

Instance methods:

.. method:: ModelView.fields_view_get(cursor, user[, view_id[, view_type[, context[, toolbar[, hexmd5]]]]])

    Return a view definition used by the client. The definition is::

        {
            'model': model name,
            'arch': XML description,
            'fields': {
                field name: {
                    ...
                },
            },
            'toolbar': {
                'print': [
                    ...
                ],
                'action': [
                    ...
                ],
                'relate': [
                    ...
                ],
            },
            ''md5': {
            },
        }

.. method:: ModelView.view_header_get(cursor, user, value[, view_type[, context]])

    Return the window title used by the client for the specific view type.

    A list of tuples defining the default order of the records:

        [ ('field name', 'ASC'), ('other field name', 'DESC'), ... ]

    where the first element of the tuple is a field name of the model and the
    second is the sort ordering as `ASC` for ascending or `DESC` for
    descending.

.. attribute:: ModelSQL._order_name

    The name of the field (or an SQL statement) on which the records must be
    sorted when sorting on this model from an other model. If not set,
    :attr:`ModelStorage._rec_name` will be used.

    If true, all changes on records will be stored in a history table.

.. attribute:: ModelSQL._sql_constraints

    A list of SQL constraints that are added on the table:

        [ ('constraint name', 'SQL constraint', 'error message key'), ... ]

    - `constraint name` is the name of the SQL constraint in the database

    - `error message key` is the key of
      :attr:`_sql_error_messages`

.. attribute:: ModelSQL._sql_error_messages
