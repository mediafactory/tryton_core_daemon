Views
#####

The views are used to display records of an object to the user.

In tryton, objects can have several views, it is the action, that opens the window, that tells which views must be used.

The views are built from XML that is stored in the databases with the object ir.ui.view.

So generally, they are defined in xml files with this kind of xml:

.. highlight:: xml

::

  <record model="ir.ui.view" id="view_id">
      <field name="model">model name</field>
      <field name="type">type name</field>
      <!--field name="inherit" ref="inherit_view_id"/-->
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <![CDATA[
          View XML ...
          ]]>
      </field>
  </record>


There is three types of views:

    * Form

    * Tree

    * Graph



Form view
*********

The RNG that describes the xml for a form view is stored in
trytond/ir/ui/form.rng.  There is also a RNC in trytond/ir/ui/form.rnc.

Form view is used to display one record of an object.

Elements of the view are put on the screen following the rules:

    * Elements are placed on the screen from left to right, from top to bottom, according the order of the xml.

    * The screen composed of a table with a fixed number of columns and enough rows to handle all elements.

    * Elements take one or more columns when they are put in the table. If there is not enough free columns on the current row, the elements is put at the begin of the next row.
